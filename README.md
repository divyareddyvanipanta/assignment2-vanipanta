<h5>My favourite location in the world is Paris</h5>

<p>**Paris** is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. People call Paris "City of Love" because of the romatic atmosphere and **Eiffel tower** is one of the world's most recognizable landmarks. <br>Especially as it glows after dark have made it one of the most visited monuments in the world. Also Paris is a nation of food lovers, all these put together made me like Paris</p>
