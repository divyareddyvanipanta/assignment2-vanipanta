### My favourite location in the world is Paris

**Paris** is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. People call Paris "City of Love" because of the romatic atmosphere and **Eiffel tower** is one of the world's most recognizable landmarks.

Especially as it glows after dark have made it one of the most visited monuments in the world. Also **Paris** is a nation of food lovers, all these put together made me like Paris
